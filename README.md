LRTCLS: Low-rank Tensor Completion with Laplacian Smoothing Regularization Term for Unveiling the post-transcriptional machinery of N6-methylation(m6A)-mediated diseases

Recently, N6-methylation(m6A) has become a hotpot since it plays a pivotal role during disease pathogenesis. Identifying disease-related m6A sites contributes to figuring out the molecular mechanisms and biosynthetic pathways of m6A-mediated diseases. Existing methods mainly reckon this problem as a binary classification issue and only focuses on whether an m6A-disease association exists or not. Although achieving excellent performance, they have one common limitation, that is, they ignored the post-transcriptional regulation events during disease pathogenesis, which are indispensable information for understanding the molecular function in m6A-related diseases. Emerging laboratory experiments have manifested that the interplays among m6A and other post-transcriptional regulation events, such as circRNA targeting, miRNA targeting, RNA binding protein (RBP) binding, and alternative splicing events, presents a manifold scenery during the tumorigenesis. Based on these findings, we proposed a low-rank tensor completion-based method to infer disease-related m6A sites and then to specify the post-transcriptional machinery of diseases pathogenesis.
